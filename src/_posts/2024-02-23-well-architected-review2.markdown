This is a fixed price project that it includes multiple meetings where we collect information and present the report.<br>
During the meetings we will do the assessment of your existing cloud infrastructure to see how it complies with the best practices from [AWS Well Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)<br>
The report includes the areas for improvements and high-level scope of work to be done.
